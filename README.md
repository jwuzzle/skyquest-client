## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

## Nice-to-haves

Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Under nice-to-haves, you can list any additional features you may complete if you have extra time, or after finishing.
